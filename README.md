# Multilanguage translator

Check translations from and to multiple languages at the same time. Useful if you are learning your third or more language and some words only come to mind in different languages. Type the list of BCP 47 language tags separated by commas into the top box to configure which languages you want to use, e.g. en,de,nl for English, German and Dutch to show up at the same time. It uses [Chrome built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/translator-api), so all the translation is done on the client side.

Current limitations:

- Only works on desktop Chrome and Opera
- Because transient activation is needed, you might have to click a button a few times to load all translator models.
